# Flight Support

This is a simple resource to calculate the following things:
- Total flight time
- Total fuel burned

Bonus:

- Beechcraft Baron G58 Pilot's Operating Handbook

I am working on this project to provide support to general aviation pilots.

<b>This is a personal project under tests and the developer is not responsible for possible errors. Always perform a crosscheck to improve your safety margin.</b>

Work in progress since December 27, 2020.
